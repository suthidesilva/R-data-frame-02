# R-data-frame-02

Transforming our data and axes has a large impact on visualizations. In the /srv/R/CSC_May21/Data folder, we have fairly recent data on the population of cities in Idaho. The data contains information from all Idaho cities with a population of at least 100. The variables are described below:

  1) **name** – Name of the city
  2) **pop2021** – population in 2021
  3) **pop2010** – population in 2010

Create an clear, nicely commented R Markdown based on the instructions below. The population of Caldwell in 2021 has an extra 0 at the end! Use R to correct this typo.
